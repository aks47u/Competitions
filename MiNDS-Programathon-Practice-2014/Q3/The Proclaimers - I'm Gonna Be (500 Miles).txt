The Proclaimers - I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)

As it happens Santa has made a bit of an error and put RGB-D software on this
years list of things that people can have. Tom is under lots of pressure to
come through for him and doesn't want to disappoint all of the doe-eyed
Computer Scientists of the world who would be very upset Christmas morning
without their new software to play with, but things are going a bit slow
copying everything onto Santa's custom flash drives. So Tom has decided that
he's going to work through the night and that Santa will have to keep calling
back to him to pick up the flashdrives as they're ready. Santa needs to work
out far away he is from NUI Maynooth each time that Tom calls him to see how
hard he has to whip those lazy blasted reindeer to get back to Tom in a set
time. Calculate the distance between NUI Maynooth and another point on the
Earth's surface where Santa will be located. Take the radius of the Earth to
be 6378.1km, the latitude of NUI Maynooth to be 53.385, and the longitude of
NUI Maynooth to be -6.602.


Input
Two doubles representing the latitude and longitude of a point on the Earth's surface.

Output
The distance between the NUI Maynooth and the other point in km, cast to an Integer.
