Fizz Buzz Woof

Alison is trying to hang up her fairy lights but keeps being interrupted by a
mer-frog, a dog and an awful electric shock. These things seem to keep
happening at set intervals. Help Alison to see the pattern by writing a
program that prints the numbers from 1 to *n*. But for multiples of three
print “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of five print “Buzz”
and for the multiples of 7 print "Woof". For numbers which are multiples of
both three and five print “FizzBuzz”, both three and seven "FizzWoof", both
five and seven "BuzzWoof" and all of three, five and seven "FizzBuzzWoof".

Input
An integer *n*, 2 <= *n* <= 500

Output
The numbers from one to *n* with "Fizz", "Buzz" and "Woof" replacing
the appropriate numbers
