Summation of Primes

Programming Jesus Conor has just solved a Project Euler question and wants to
test his Haskell code vs whatever the hell you're using so he can feel smug
and tell you that your language is shit. Find the sum of all the primes up to
and including an integer n, if n is prime.

Input An integer n, 2 <= n <= 1,000,000 Output The sum of all the primes up
to and including n, if n is prime.

Sample Testcases
Input 1
9
Output 1
17
 
Input 2
100
Output 2
