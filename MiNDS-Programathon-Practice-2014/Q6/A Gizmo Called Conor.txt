A Gizmo Called Conor

You've been given Gizmo from the film Gremlins as a pet. One rule you must
follow is Gizmo is never allowed eat after midnight under any circumstances
or weird things will happen. Now you're a crafty programmer who likes to
spoil his pet and plan ahead so you've decided to write a program that
calculates how many pieces of ham Gizmo will eat between 2 times. Here are
the eating rules you came up with:

1) Gizmo is not allowed to eat anything between midnight and 6am (he can eat
  in the 6am-7am hour).
2) Gizmo gets 3 pieces of ham per hour after 6am until 1pm.
3) Gizmo gets 2 pieces of ham per hour after 1pm until 6pm.
4) Gizmo gets 1 piece of ham per hour after 6pm until midnight.

Note: You'll take in 2 numbers using input: The hour to start at and the hour
  to end before.
Note: We'll use a 24 hour clock. 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight, 1 is 1am
Note: The time period might span over 2 days, think about how you could reset
  the hour to 0 when you reach 24
